1. **Core Authentication**
   - Supabase Auth integration with role-based access control
   - User profiles with church affiliations and missionary goals
   - Multiple user roles: Missionaries, Finance Officers, Campus Directors, Lead Pastors, and SuperAdmins

2. **Donation Management**
   - Manual donation entry and remittance
   - Donor tracking and history
   - Advanced reporting system with real-time calculations
   - Optimized state management and error handling

3. **Approval Workflows**
   - Leave requests and surplus requests
   - Two-level approval system (Campus Director â†’ Lead Pastor)
   - Request history tracking

4. **Role-Specific Dashboards**
   - Missionary dashboard with donation tracking
   - Finance officer dashboard for donation management
   - Lead pastor dashboard for approvals
   - SuperAdmin dashboard for system-wide management

### Current System Architecture

1. **Frontend**
   - Next.js 13+ with App Router

   - Server actions for bypassing RLS when needed
   - Real-time subscriptions for live updates

3. **Database Schema**
   - `profiles`: User profiles with roles and church affiliations
   - `donor_donations`: Donation records with missionary and donor references
   - `donors`: Donor information
   - `surplus_requests`: Surplus withdrawal requests
   - `local_churches`: Church information

4. **Key Components**
   - `ManualRemittanceWizard`: Multi-step form for recording offline donations
   - `FinanceRemittanceWizard`: Enhanced wizard for finance officers
   - `DonationModal`: Simple donation entry form
   - `RecentDonations`: Display of recent donation transactions
   - Advanced reporting components for missionaries, churches, and partners

### Current Limitations
- Only supports manual donation entry
- No online payment processing
- Finance officers must manually record all donations
- No automated receipt generation
- Limited donor engagement options

## Xendit Integration Purpose

The Xendit integration aims to address these limitations by enabling:

1. **Online Donations**
   - Direct donations to missionaries through public profiles
   - Church/ministry donations through a central giving page
   - Streamlined payment experience for donors

2. **Automated Processing**
   - Automatic recording of successful payments
   - Real-time payment status updates
   - Reduced manual data entry for finance team

3. **Enhanced Donor Experience**
   - Multiple payment options (credit card, e-wallet, bank transfer)
   - Immediate confirmation and receipts
   - Mobile-friendly donation process

## Integration Points

### 1. Public Giving Page
- **Current Status**: Does not exist
- **Location**: Will be created at `app/giving/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Allow public visitors to donate to missionaries or churches
- **User Flow**:
  1. User selects missionary or church
  2. Enters donation amount and personal details
  3. Submits form and is redirected to Xendit payment page
  4. Completes payment and returns to success/failure page
  5. System automatically records donation in database

### 2. Manual Remittance Wizard Enhancement
- **Current Status**: Exists at `components/ManualRemittanceWizard.tsx`
- **Current Functionality**: 
  - Multi-step form for recording offline donations
  - Used by campus missionaries to record partner donations
  - Creates donor records and donation entries
- **Enhancement Needed**:
  - Add online payment option for partners who prefer to pay electronically
  - Generate payment links that can be shared with partners
  - Track payment status and update records automatically

### 3. Finance Dashboard Integration
- **Current Status**: Finance dashboard exists with manual remittance wizard
- **Location**: `app/dashboard/finance/page.tsx`
- **Enhancement Needed**:
  - Add payment transaction history view
  - Implement reconciliation tools for online payments
  - Add payment status indicators for pending transactions

## Database Context

### Existing Schema Relevant to Integration

```sql
-- Existing tables that will interact with Xendit integration

-- User profiles
profiles (
  id uuid references auth.users(id),
  full_name text,
  role text,
  local_church_id uuid,
  monthly_goal numeric(10,2),
  surplus_balance numeric(10,2),
  created_at timestamptz
)

-- Donation records
donor_donations (
  id bigserial primary key,
  missionary_id uuid references auth.users(id),
  donor_id uuid references donors(id),
  amount numeric(10,2),
  date timestamptz,
  source varchar(20), -- 'online' or 'offline'
  status varchar(20), -- 'completed', 'pending', 'failed'
  recorded_by uuid references auth.users(id),
  created_at timestamptz,
  updated_at timestamptz
)

-- Donor information
donors (
  id uuid primary key,
  name text not null,
  email text,
  phone text,
  created_at timestamptz,
  updated_at timestamptz
)

-- Churches
local_churches (
  id serial primary key,
  name text not null,
  lead_pastor_id uuid references auth.users(id),
  created_at timestamptz,
  updated_at timestamptz
)
```

### RLS Policies to Consider

The system uses Row Level Security (RLS) policies that must be considered:

1. **donor_donations Table**:
   - Requires `recorded_by` field to be set to the authenticated user's ID
   - Finance officers can view all donations
   - Missionaries can only view their own donations
   - Campus directors can view donations for missionaries in their church

2. **donors Table**:
   - All authenticated users can view donors
   - Only finance officers and missionaries can create donors

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Backend Services (Priority: High)

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: RLS Policy Compliance
**Problem**: The system uses Row Level Security (RLS) policies that require the `recorded_by` field to be set to the authenticated user's ID.

**Solution**: 
- For authenticated users, set `recorded_by` to their user ID
- For public donations, use a server action with service role to bypass RLS
- Create a system user for recording public donations
- Implement proper validation to ensure RLS compliance

### Challenge 2: Webhook Handling
**Problem**: Webhooks must be processed reliably, even with network issues or database failures.

**Solution**:
- Log all webhook payloads before processing
- Implement idempotency to handle duplicate webhooks
- Use database transactions for atomic updates
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Return 200 OK to Xendit even if processing fails (to prevent retries)

### Challenge 3: Payment Status Tracking
**Problem**: Payment status must be accurately tracked and reflected in the UI.

**Solution**:
- Create a robust status tracking system in the database
- Implement real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
- Add clear status indicators in the UI
- Implement polling for status updates on relevant pages
- Add comprehensive error handling for failed payments
