# Current Working Progress

## Task Overview
We're creating the proper documents needed for a handoff. They need to be comprehensive and detailed so that any senior dev / any AI can look at the documents and continue efficiently without the need to go through all the codebase. 

Your task therefore is to go through all the codebase and: 
1. Understand the codebase
2. Document the codebase with detailed comments on the files
3. Update TechnicalImplementation.md and other necessary documents with the details.
4. update the ##ComponentsAnalyzed section with the latest components you've analyzed and the #NextComponentsToAnalyze section with the next components you'll be analyzing.
5. Read the instructions in ./instructions/workingProgress.md to understand how to do your job and then repeat until all the components for all the dashboards have been analyzed, and the documents are complete. 


Files in ./instructions:
- we have a roadmap.md that talks about the whole project as an overview
- TechnicalSpecifications.md is the next step to document the technical side of the project that needs to be done
- TechnicalImplementation.md is the current implementation of the project
- WorkingProgress.md is your current progress as AI on this task
