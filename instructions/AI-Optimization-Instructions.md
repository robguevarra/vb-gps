# AI Optimization Instructions for Staff Portal

## üéØ Core Instructions

When working on the Staff Portal optimization project, follow these instructions:

1. **Focus on one component at a time**
   - Complete optimization of the current component before moving to the next
   - Follow the component-by-component approach outlined in the Implementation Strategy

2. **Maintain documentation continuity**
   - Reference and update component documentation with each change
   - Document all decisions, challenges, and solutions
   - Create implementation snapshots after significant progress

3. **Follow the optimization patterns**
   - Convert appropriate components to server components
   - Implement proper data fetching strategies
   - Add skeleton loaders and animations per guidelines
   - Extract interactive elements to client components

4. **Prioritize performance metrics**
   - Focus on reducing JavaScript bundle size
   - Eliminate data fetching waterfalls
   - Improve initial page load times
   - Enhance perceived performance with animations

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Checklist

For each component optimization, complete these steps:

- [ ] Review current implementation and documentation
- [ ] Analyze performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Create implementation plan
- [ ] Convert to server component (if applicable)
- [ ] Optimize data fetching
- [ ] Extract interactive elements to client components
- [ ] Implement skeleton loaders
- [ ] Add animations per guidelines
- [ ] Test functionality
- [ ] Measure performance improvements
- [ ] Update component documentation
- [ ] Create implementation snapshot

## üìä Performance Targets

Aim for these performance improvements:

| Metric | Target Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|
| Initial Page Load | > 70% |
| Time to Interactive | > 65% |
| JavaScript Bundle Size | > 50% |
| First Contentful Paint | > 60% |

## üß© Component Optimization Patterns

### Pattern 1: Data Display Components
- Convert to server components
- Implement parallel data fetching
- Add skeleton loaders
- Use staggered animations for lists

### Pattern 2: Interactive Components
- Keep as client components
- Extract from server components
- Optimize re-renders
- Add micro-interactions

### Pattern 3: Layout Components
- Convert container to server component
- Extract interactive elements
- Implement progressive loading
- Add page transitions

## üîÑ Workflow Example

```
# Session: Optimizing DashboardStats Component

## Context
I'm working on optimizing the DashboardStats component in the Staff Portal.
Current status: Client component with useEffect for data fetching.
Previous work: Created component documentation and analysis.

## Component Analysis
Component type: Data display
Current implementation: Client component
Performance issues: Multiple API calls creating waterfall, no loading states
Optimization priority: High

## Implementation Plan
Planned changes:
1. Convert to server component
2. Implement parallel data fetching
3. Add skeleton loader
4. Extract filter controls to client component

Expected outcomes:
- 70% reduction in load time
- Elimination of data fetching waterfall
- Improved UX with skeleton loading
- Reduced JavaScript bundle size

## Implementation
[Code implementation details]

## Session Summary
Completed:
- Converted DashboardStats to server component
- Implemented parallel data fetching
- Created skeleton loader component

Next steps:
- Extract filter controls to client component
- Add animations for data updates
- Test performance improvements

Open questions:
- Should we implement caching for this data?
- How to handle real-time updates?
```

## üìö Reference Documentation

When needed, refer to these documents:
