1. Improve animation by looking at ./Animation-Guidelines.md
2. Improve and optimize by looking at ./Peformance-Optimziation.md and Server-Components-Migration.md
3. Document everything in a progres.md file

1. Analyze dashboard structure. and map out all components used. 
2. Make a progress plan
3. Update progress plan
4. Make Decision-progress document for all changes/decisions made. 

1. AI looks at progress plan
2. Ai looks at Decision Progress
3. AI looks at guideliens
4. AI Works on components. 
5. AI Updates progress plan and decision progress. 


We are optizing our App using @Animation-Guidelines.md , @Performance-Optimization-Guide.md and @Server-Components-Migration.md 

We will work with this step by step so it is crucial that you read through all of the documents. 

First, let's work on Missionary dashboard (/app/dashboard/missionary/page.tsx)
Make a list of all the components that are used by the Missionary Dashboard. 

And write a progress document that will track all the components that have been worked on. 

Write another Decision tracking document that will track all the decisions and changes and the rationale behind them. 

Do you understand these instructions? 



We're continuing the optimization. 

We are optimizing using @Animation-Guidelines.md , @Performance-Optimization-Guide.md and @Server-Components-Migration.md as guidelines. read them carefully to make sure you know what to do. 

Update yourself also with our progress here:
@animation-implementation.md @optimization-progress.md and @optimization-decisions.md

what part of Missionary Dashboard should we continue to work on?
let's work on it one by one, making sure we don't miss any instructions. 

Please only work on a single tab. Do not touch ManualRemittanceWizardTab yet.
