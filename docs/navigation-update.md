# Navigation Update: Simplified Navigation Experience

## What Changed

We've simplified the navigation in the Staff Portal by removing the duplicate tab navigation at the top of the dashboard. Now, all navigation is handled through the sidebar, providing a cleaner, more consistent experience.

## Why We Made This Change

We noticed that having both sidebar navigation and tab navigation with the same items was:

1. **Redundant** - The same options appeared in two places
2. **Confusing** - Users weren't sure which navigation method to use
3. **Cluttered** - The duplicate navigation took up valuable screen space

## Benefits of the New Navigation

- **Cleaner Interface** - Less visual clutter and a more focused experience
- **Consistent Navigation** - One clear way to navigate throughout the application
- **Same Fast Performance** - We've maintained all the speed improvements of our tab system
- **Better Mobile Experience** - Simplified navigation works better on smaller screens

## How It Works

- All navigation options are now in the sidebar
- Clicking a navigation item instantly loads the corresponding content
- The sidebar highlights your current location
- On mobile, the sidebar becomes a drawer menu accessible via the menu button

## Technical Details

While we've simplified the UI, we've maintained all the technical benefits of our previous implementation:

- Client-side navigation for instant page transitions
- Background prefetching of content for faster navigation
- Content caching for frequently accessed sections
- Optimized loading patterns that prioritize important content first
