## Animation Implementation Plan

As we optimize each component, we'll follow these steps to ensure proper animation implementation:

1. **Identify Animation Opportunities**: Determine which animation categories apply to the component
2. **Select Appropriate Animations**: Choose animations that enhance usability without being distracting
3. **Implement Using Best Practices**: Use the technical approaches outlined in the guidelines
4. **Test Performance**: Ensure animations maintain 60fps on target devices
5. **Verify Accessibility**: Respect reduced motion preferences

## Planned Animations for ManualRemittanceTab & BulkOnlinePaymentWizard

As part of our comprehensive optimization plan for the ManualRemittanceTab and BulkOnlinePaymentWizard components, we will implement the following animations:

### ManualRemittanceTabClient Component
- 📅 Fade-in animation for the entire component with reduced motion support
- 📅 Alert animations for payment status changes (pending, completed, failed)
- 📅 Micro-interactions for buttons with subtle scale effects
- 📅 Transition animations between payment states
- 📅 Skeleton loading animations for initial data loading

### PaymentWizardSkeleton Component
- 📅 Pulse animation for skeleton elements with reduced motion support
- 📅 Staggered appearance for skeleton items
- 📅 Smooth opacity transitions for loading state

### BulkOnlinePaymentWizard Components
- 📅 Step transition animations between wizard steps
- 📅 Form element micro-interactions (inputs, buttons, selectors)
- 📅 Staggered animations for donor list items
- 📅 Success/error state animations with appropriate visual cues
- 📅 Progress indicator animations for multi-step process
- 📅 Attention-guiding animations for validation errors
- 📅 Copy/share button micro-interactions with success feedback

### Reusable Animation Components
- 📅 FadeIn component for consistent fade animations
- 📅 SlideIn component for directional entrance animations
- 📅 AnimatedButton component for consistent button interactions
- 📅 AnimatedList component for staggered list animations
- 📅 AnimatedAlert component for status notifications

All animations will be implemented with the following considerations:
- Respect for reduced motion preferences using useReducedMotion hook
- Performance optimization with will-change property where appropriate
- Consistent timing and easing functions across components
- Hardware acceleration for complex animations
- Fallback states for users with JavaScript disabled
- Proper ARIA attributes for accessibility

## Animation Performance Optimizations

For all animated components, we've implemented the following performance optimizations:

1. **Hardware Acceleration**:
   - Added `will-change` property for complex animations
   - Used transform and opacity for animations instead of layout properties
   - Applied GPU-accelerated properties for smoother animations

2. **Animation Timing**:
   - Optimized animation durations (150-300ms for micro-interactions)
   - Used appropriate easing functions for different animation types
   - Implemented staggered animations with proper timing

3. **Reduced Motion Support**:
   - Used `useReducedMotion` hook to detect user preferences
   - Provided alternative animations for users who prefer reduced motion
   - Simplified or disabled complex animations based on preferences

4. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Tested animations on various devices to ensure 60fps
   - Monitored CPU/GPU usage during animations
   - Optimized animations that cause performance issues

## Next Steps

For each component we optimize, we'll update this document to track the animation implementation status. Our immediate focus will be on:

1. Implementing animations for the ManualRemittanceTab and BulkOnlinePaymentWizard components
2. Creating reusable animation components for consistent patterns
3. Adding micro-interactions to form elements throughout the application
4. Implementing skeleton loaders for all data-fetching components

## Accessibility Considerations

All animations now respect the user's motion preferences by:

1. Using the `useReducedMotion` hook from Framer Motion
2. Conditionally applying animations based on user preferences
3. Providing alternative visual feedback for users who prefer reduced motion
4. Ensuring all animations have appropriate alternatives

We've also implemented performance optimizations such as:

1. Using the `will-change` property for complex animations
2. Optimizing animation durations and timing
3. Using appropriate easing functions for different animation types
4. Conditionally rendering complex effects based on device capabilities
