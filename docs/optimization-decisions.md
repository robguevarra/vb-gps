# Optimization Decisions

This document tracks key architectural and implementation decisions made during the optimization process.

## Server Component Strategy

**Decision**: Implement a phased approach starting with data-heavy components.

**Rationale**: 
- Data-heavy components like dashboards, reports, and lists benefit most from server rendering
- Interactive components require more careful architecture to maintain functionality
- Phased approach allows for iterative improvement and testing

**Implementation Pattern**:
1. Pure Server Components: For display-only components (ReportCards, StatsDisplay)
2. Hybrid Architecture: Server wrapper + client islands for interactive components (ManualRemittanceTab)
3. Client-only: For highly interactive components with minimal data requirements (AnimatedHeader)

## Component Streaming Strategy

**Decision**: Implement multi-level nested Suspense boundaries for granular streaming.

**Rationale**:
- Traditional approaches wait for all data before rendering anything
- Single-level Suspense boundaries still block entire sections
- Multi-level nested Suspense allows for more granular streaming
- Users see meaningful UI almost instantly, with content progressively filling in

**Implementation Pattern**:
1. UI Shell Layer: Loads immediately (DashboardShell)
2. Component Structure Layer: Loads next (section headers, containers)
3. Data-Dependent Layer: Loads progressively (cards, tables, charts)
4. Tailored skeleton loaders for each component
5. Component-level data fetching for better separation of concerns

## Tab Navigation Strategy

**Decision**: Implement client-side tab navigation with multi-level prefetching.

**Rationale**:
- Server-side tab navigation causes noticeable delays (2-3 seconds)
- Full page reloads disrupt user experience and feel slow
- Users expect instant tab switching in modern web applications
- Prefetching can make tab switching feel instant even with server components

**Implementation Pattern**:
1. Client-side Navigation: Use Next.js router for client-side tab switching
2. Hover Prefetching: Prefetch tab data when user hovers over a tab
3. Background Prefetching: Proactively prefetch all tabs after initial load
4. Prioritized Loading: Load most likely tabs first, then others
5. Immediate Visual Feedback: Show tab as active immediately, even before content loads
6. Tab-specific Skeleton Loaders: Show appropriate skeleton for each tab type

## Animation Implementation

**Decision**: Implement a comprehensive animation system with accessibility support.

**Rationale**:
- Animations improve perceived performance and user engagement
- Consistent animation patterns create a polished experience
- Accessibility requirements demand reduced motion support

**Implementation Pattern**:
1. CSS Transitions: For simple state changes and hover effects
2. Framer Motion: For complex animations, page transitions, and staggered lists
3. useReducedMotion Hook: To disable/simplify animations based on user preferences
4. Dedicated animation components for reuse (FadeIn, SlideIn)

## ManualRemittanceTab Architecture

**Decision**: Implement a hybrid server/client architecture with Zustand state management.

**Rationale**:
- Complex form workflows benefit from client-side state management
- Initial data should be fetched on the server for faster initial load
- User interactions need to be responsive without page reloads

**Implementation Pattern**:
1. Server Component: Fetch initial data and missionary details
2. Client Component: Handle form state, validation, and submission
3. Zustand Store: Manage complex form state across steps
4. React Query: Handle server mutations with optimistic updates

## Data Fetching Strategy

**Decision**: Move data fetching to the server with parallel requests.

**Rationale**:
- Server-side data fetching eliminates client waterfalls
- Parallel requests with Promise.all improve performance
- Server can pre-process data before sending to client

**Implementation Pattern**:
1. Promise.all for multiple data sources
2. Server-side data transformation
3. React Query for dynamic client updates
4. Type validation on data boundaries

## Navigation Components

**Decision**: Keep as client components with optimized animations.

**Rationale**:
- Navigation is inherently interactive
- State persistence is required between navigation events
- Animation transitions improve perceived performance

**Implementation Pattern**:
1. Client components with minimal dependencies
2. Framer Motion for transitions
3. Lazy loading for sub-components
4. Active state tracking with React state

## Error Handling System

**Decision**: Implement a comprehensive error boundary system.

**Rationale**:
- Graceful error recovery improves user experience
- Isolated error boundaries prevent entire UI from failing
- Consistent error UX creates professional appearance

**Implementation Pattern**:
1. Global ErrorBoundaryProvider
2. Component-specific error boundaries
3. Fallback UI for different error scenarios
4. Error logging and reporting

## ReportsTab Implementation

**Decision**: Implement a hybrid architecture with server-side data processing.

**Rationale**:
- Reports involve heavy data processing that should happen on the server
- Interactive elements (tab switching, filtering) require client components
- Mobile-specific layout requires responsive optimization

**Implementation Pattern**:
1. Server component for data fetching and processing
2. Client component for UI rendering and interactions
3. Pre-calculated statistics for performance
4. Skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
5. Optimized mobile-specific code paths
6. Animated transitions between tabs with Framer Motion
7. Support for reduced motion preferences

## RecentDonations Implementation

**Decision**: Convert to a hybrid architecture with optimized animations.

**Rationale**:
- Component receives pre-processed data but has complex animations
- Many nested motion elements causing performance issues
- Modal integration can be improved with React Query

**Implementation Pattern**:
1. Server wrapper for centralized data fetching
2. Client component with optimized animations
3. Simplified animation variants
4. Custom hook for donor history data
5. Skeleton loader for loading states
6. useReducedMotion support for accessibility

## Donor Search Implementation

**Decision**: Create enterprise-grade search with pagination and infinite scrolling.

**Rationale**:
- Donor search is a critical and frequently used feature
- Performance matters for large donor databases
- User experience should be fluid and responsive

**Implementation Pattern**:
1. Server-side search API with efficient queries
2. Client-side pagination with React Virtual
3. Debounced search input for performance
4. Skeleton loading states during search
5. Error handling for failed searches

## Bundle Size Optimization Strategy

**Decision**: Implement code splitting and dynamic imports for heavy components.

**Rationale**:
- Large JavaScript bundles impact initial load performance
- Many components aren't needed for initial page render
- Some components have heavy dependencies that can be loaded on demand
- Progressive loading improves perceived performance

**Implementation Pattern**:
1. Bundle analysis with @next/bundle-analyzer to identify targets
2. Dynamic imports with Next.js dynamic() function
3. Dedicated skeleton loaders for better UX during loading
4. Error boundaries for reliability
5. Preloading for anticipated user actions

**Primary Targets**:
- Wizard components (ManualRemittanceWizard, FinanceRemittanceWizard)
- Modal components (DonorHistoryModal, SurplusRequestModal)
- Visualization components (LineChart, DonationStats)
- Virtualized lists (VirtualizedDonorList)

**Reference Implementation**:
- BulkOnlinePaymentWizardWrapper serves as the template for all dynamic imports
