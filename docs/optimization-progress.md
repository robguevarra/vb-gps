   - Run Lighthouse audits before and after each optimization phase
   - Focus on Performance, Accessibility, and Best Practices scores
   - Test on both mobile and desktop devices

2. **React Profiler**:
   - Use React Profiler to measure component render times
   - Identify components with excessive re-renders
   - Track improvements after memoization and other optimizations

3. **Bundle Analysis**:
   - Use tools like `next-bundle-analyzer` to measure bundle size changes
   - Track code splitting effectiveness
   - Identify opportunities for further optimization

4. **User Experience Metrics**:
   - Measure time to interactive for key user flows
   - Track input delay and response times
   - Measure animation smoothness (frames per second)

5. **Real Device Testing**:
   - Test on various devices (high-end, mid-range, low-end)
   - Test on different network conditions (fast, slow, flaky)
   - Measure battery impact on mobile devices

The results of these measurements will be documented and used to guide further optimizations.
