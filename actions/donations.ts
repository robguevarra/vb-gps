/**
 * Server Actions for Donation Management
 * 
 * This module provides server-side actions for donation-related operations.
 * Using server actions allows us to:
 * 1. Bypass RLS restrictions using the service role key
 * 2. Keep sensitive database logic on the server
 * 3. Maintain security while enabling necessary operations
 * 
 * These actions are used by client components that need to perform
 * operations that might be restricted by RLS policies.

/**
 * Submits multiple donation entries while handling RLS and permission issues
 * 
 * IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
 * 
 * 1. ROW LEVEL SECURITY BYPASS:
 *    This function uses the admin client with service role key to bypass RLS,
 *    but we also explicitly set the recorded_by field to the missionary_id to
 *    satisfy RLS policies that check this field.
 * 
 * 2. INDIVIDUAL INSERTS APPROACH:
 *    We process each donation individually to minimize transaction conflicts
 *    and to allow partial success even if some donations fail.
 * 
 * 3. ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY:
 *    We track successful inserts and continue processing even after errors,
 *    allowing for partial success scenarios where some donations are recorded
 *    while others fail.
 * 
 * 4. MATERIALIZED VIEW CONSIDERATIONS:
 *    The donor_donations table may have triggers that refresh materialized views,
 *    which can cause permission issues. This implementation handles those errors
 *    gracefully.
 * 
 * @param entries - Array of donation entries to submit
 * @returns Object containing success status and detailed results
