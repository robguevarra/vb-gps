1. Overview & Analytics
System-Wide Metrics:
Total Donations: Display the sum of donations across all missionaries.
Total Leave & Surplus Requests: Show the number of pending, approved, and rejected requests in real time.
Monthly Trends: Include graphs/charts that indicate donation trends and donor engagement over time.
Performance Analytics:
Missionary Comparison: Compare individual missionary performances (monthly goals vs. actual donations).
Regional/Church Stats: If applicable, break down metrics by church, region, or district.
Live Notifications:
Real-time alerts for critical events (e.g., unusually large donations, new campaigns) using WebSockets or Supabase’s Realtime features.
---
2. User & Role Management
User Profiles:
A searchable, paginated list of all users (missionaries, finance officers, campus directors, etc.).
Ability to view, edit, and deactivate/reactivate profiles.
Role Assignment & Permissions:
Assign and update roles directly from the dashboard.
Manage permissions to control which users see what functions.
Audit Logs & Activity Tracking:
Record system events, such as when user details are updated or when large transactions occur.

3. Request & Transaction Management
Approval Dashboard:
Mirror or expand the functionality of the existing “Approvals” tab to allow SuperAdmins to override or fast-track requests (leave, surplus, etc.) across the organization.
Manual Adjustments & Corrections:
Ability to manually correct donation entries or request statuses if errors are observed.
Issue Resolution:
A ticketing or comment system for tracking issues or disputes related to donations and requests.
---
4. Reports & Data Export
Comprehensive Reports:
In addition to the mission-specific reports (e.g., Last 13 Months, Partners), SuperAdmins can view consolidated reports aggregated from all missions.
Advanced filtering options (by date, region, missionary, donation size, etc.).
Data Export:
Ability to download CSV or Excel export of donors, donations, and request data.
Customizable Dashboards:
Let SuperAdmins create or save custom views and filters for the data.

5. System Configuration & Settings
Application Settings:
Configure thresholds and settings for goals, request approvals, surplus allocation, etc.
Notification Settings:
Set up email or SMS notifications for critical system events.
Integration Management:
Manage integrations with third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, email services).
---
6. UI/UX Considerations
Navigation:
A sidebar (or top navigation) that cleanly segments sections (Overview, Users, Requests, Reports, Settings).
Clear breadcrumbs and filtering options for a complex data set.
Data Visualization:
Use charts and graphs (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts) to make large data sets digestible.
Responsive design to support both desktop and mobile views.
Alerts & Highlights:
Clearly indicate items that require immediate attention (e.g., a surge in pending requests).
Role-Based Customization:
Ensure the SuperAdmin dashboard shows controls and metrics not visible to lower-tier users.

By including these functions, a SuperAdmin dashboard not only displays key performance indicators and detailed reports but also provides tools for active system management, enabling quick decisions and adjustments across the whole platform. This comprehensive view empowers the SuperAdmin to maintain oversight and ensure the smooth operation of the entire system.
