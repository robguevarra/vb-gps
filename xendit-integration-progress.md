## Current Focus

- Monitoring system in production

## Recent Activity
- Created progress tracking document
- Updated progress to reflect existing database schema
- Implemented Xendit service with core functionality
- Created API endpoints for invoice creation, webhook handling, and status checking
- Implemented public giving page with donation form
- Created payment success and failure pages
- Created OnlinePaymentWizard component for missionaries to generate payment links
- Created payment link generation page
- Installed @hookform/resolvers package for form validation
- Fixed system user ID issue to comply with RLS policies
- Updated code to handle schema differences (`local_church_id` column missing in `donor_donations`)
- Fixed check constraint violation on status field by using valid values
- Fixed payment flow to correctly mark donations as pending until payment is confirmed via webhook
- Fixed webhook handler to properly update transaction and donation statuses
- Added detailed logging throughout the payment process

## Next Steps
1. Create user documentation for missionaries and donors
2. Monitor payment flows in production
3. Consider enhancements for future versions

## Blockers / Issues
- ✅ RESOLVED: Foreign key constraint on `created_by` field - Fixed by using a valid system user ID
- ✅ RESOLVED: Schema mismatch with `local_church_id` field - Fixed by using `missionary_id` for all recipient types
- ✅ RESOLVED: Check constraint on `status` field - Fixed by using valid values
- ✅ RESOLVED: Permission issue with materialized view - Fixed by using a custom database function with elevated privileges
- ✅ RESOLVED: Incorrect donation status flow - Fixed by marking donations as "pending" initially and only updating to "completed" after payment confirmation

## Environment Setup
To work on this integration, engineers need:

1. Xendit sandbox account credentials
2. Environment variables configured:
   ```
   XENDIT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   XENDIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   XENDIT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
   XENDIT_CALLBACK_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/api/xendit-webhook
   XENDIT_SUCCESS_REDIRECT_URL=https://your-app-url.com/payment/success
   XENDIT_FAILURE_REDIRECT_URL=https://your-app-url.com/payment/failure
   ```
3. ngrok or similar tool for testing webhooks locally
4. Valid system user ID (currently: `fa5060a6-3996-46ea-ae5f-bd3fed7e251a`)

## Database Schema Notes
- The `donor_donations` table uses `missionary_id` for all recipient types (both missionaries and churches)
- For church donations, we add a prefix in the description to indicate it's a church donation
- Future enhancement: Consider adding a `recipient_type` field to distinguish between missionary and church donations
- The `status` field in `donor_donations` has a check constraint limiting values to specific options

## Payment Flow Process
1. **Invoice Creation:**
   - User submits donation form
   - System creates payment_transaction record with status="pending"
   - System creates donor_donation record with status="pending"
   - System generates Xendit invoice and provides payment URL
   - User is redirected to Xendit payment page

2. **Payment Processing:**
   - User completes payment on Xendit platform
   - Xendit sends webhook with event="invoice.paid" to our webhook endpoint
   - System verifies webhook signature
   - System updates payment_transaction record to status="paid"
   - System updates donor_donation record to status="completed"

3. **Payment Expiration:**
   - If payment is not completed within expiry time, Xendit sends webhook with event="invoice.expired"
   - System verifies webhook signature
   - System updates payment_transaction record to status="expired"
   - System updates donor_donation record to status="failed"

## System User and RLS Notes
- The application uses a dedicated "system user" ID for recording transactions that don't have an authenticated user
- This is required due to Row Level Security (RLS) policies and foreign key constraints
- For production, consider creating a dedicated service account rather than using a regular user account
- All payment-related tables use RLS policies to control access based on the `created_by` field

## Additional Notes
- Make sure to test with Xendit's test credit cards
- Be mindful of RLS policies when implementing payment processing
- Focus on security and data integrity throughout implementation
- Handle network failures gracefully in the payment flow
- Implement proper loading and error states in the UI
- For testing, use Xendit test cards:
  - Success: 4000000000000002
  - Failure: 4000000000000036
  - Authentication Required: 4000000000000028
