## Blockers / Issues
- ✅ RESOLVED: Foreign key constraint on `created_by` field - Fixed by using a valid system user ID
- ✅ RESOLVED: Schema mismatch with `local_church_id` field - Fixed by using `missionary_id` for all recipient types
- ✅ RESOLVED: Check constraint on `status` field - Fixed by using valid values
- ✅ RESOLVED: Permission issue with materialized view - Fixed by creating a custom database function with SECURITY DEFINER privilege
- ✅ RESOLVED: Incorrect donation status flow - Fixed by marking donations as "pending" initially and only updating to "completed" after payment confirmation
- ✅ RESOLVED: Sensitive data logging - Removed console logs containing sensitive information

## Environment Setup
To work on this integration, engineers need:

1. Xendit sandbox account credentials
2. Environment variables configured:
   ```
   XENDIT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   XENDIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   XENDIT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
   XENDIT_CALLBACK_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/api/xendit-webhook
   XENDIT_SUCCESS_REDIRECT_URL=https://your-app-url.com/payment/success
   XENDIT_FAILURE_REDIRECT_URL=https://your-app-url.com/payment/failure
   ```
3. ngrok or similar tool for testing webhooks locally
4. Valid system user ID (currently: `fa5060a6-3996-46ea-ae5f-bd3fed7e251a`)
5. SQL function `insert_single_donation` installed in the database

## Database Schema Notes
- The `donor_donations` table uses `missionary_id` for all recipient types (both missionaries and churches)
- For church donations, we add a prefix in the description to indicate it's a church donation
- Future enhancement: Consider adding a `recipient_type` field to distinguish between missionary and church donations
- The `status` field in `donor_donations` has a check constraint limiting values to specific options
- The `missionary_monthly_stats` materialized view is refreshed by a trigger on the `donor_donations` table
- We use a custom function with SECURITY DEFINER to bypass the materialized view refresh when creating donations via webhook

## Payment Flow Process
1. **Invoice Creation:**
   - User submits donation form
   - System creates payment_transaction record with status="pending"
   - System creates invoice_item record linking the transaction to potential donation
   - System generates Xendit invoice and provides payment URL
   - User is redirected to Xendit payment page

2. **Payment Processing:**
   - User completes payment on Xendit platform
   - Xendit sends webhook with event="invoice.paid" to our webhook endpoint
   - System verifies webhook signature
   - System updates payment_transaction record to status="paid"
   - System creates donor_donation record with status="completed" using the custom function
   - System updates invoice_item with the donation reference

3. **Payment Expiration:**
   - If payment is not completed within expiry time, Xendit sends webhook with event="invoice.expired"
   - System verifies webhook signature
   - System updates payment_transaction record to status="expired"
   - No donor_donation record is created for expired payments

## Materialized View Solution
To solve the permission issue with the `missionary_monthly_stats` materialized view, we implemented:

1. A custom SQL function `insert_single_donation` with SECURITY DEFINER privilege
2. This function runs with the privileges of its creator (database owner)
3. The webhook handler calls this function via RPC instead of directly inserting into the donor_donations table
4. This bypasses the trigger that would refresh the materialized view
5. The materialized view can be refreshed separately on a schedule

## System User and RLS Notes
- The application uses a dedicated "system user" ID for recording transactions that don't have an authenticated user
- This is required due to Row Level Security (RLS) policies and foreign key constraints
- For production, consider creating a dedicated service account rather than using a regular user account
- All payment-related tables use RLS policies to control access based on the `created_by` field

## Security Best Practices
- Never log sensitive payment information (API keys, card details, etc.)
- Always verify webhook signatures to prevent unauthorized requests
- Use environment variables for all sensitive credentials
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- Use service role clients only when absolutely necessary and with proper validation
- Regularly audit code for security vulnerabilities
- Follow the principle of least privilege for database operations

## Additional Notes
- Make sure to test with Xendit's test credit cards
- Be mindful of RLS policies when implementing payment processing
- Focus on security and data integrity throughout implementation
- Handle network failures gracefully in the payment flow
- Implement proper loading and error states in the UI
- For testing, use Xendit test cards:
  - Success: 4000000000000002
  - Failure: 4000000000000036
  - Authentication Required: 4000000000000028

## Frontend Developer Guide

### Getting Started with Xendit Integration

This guide provides frontend developers with the necessary information to work with our Xendit payment integration. It covers the available components, hooks, and best practices for implementing payment flows.

#### Available Components

1. **BulkOnlinePaymentWizard**
   - **Purpose**: Allows missionaries to collect donations from multiple partners using a single payment link
   - **Location**: `components/BulkOnlinePaymentWizard.tsx`
   - **Usage Example**:
   ```tsx
   import { BulkOnlinePaymentWizard } from "@/components/BulkOnlinePaymentWizard";
   
   // Inside your component
   <BulkOnlinePaymentWizard
     missionaryId={missionaryId}
     missionaryName={missionaryName}
     title="Manual Remittance"
     onSuccess={handleBulkOnlineSuccess}
     onError={handleBulkOnlineError}
   />
   ```
   - **Props**:
     - `missionaryId` (string): ID of the missionary generating the payment link
     - `missionaryName` (string): Name of the missionary (for display purposes)
     - `title` (string, optional): Custom title for the wizard
     - `onSuccess` (function, optional): Callback function after successful link generation
     - `onError` (function, optional): Callback function after link generation failure

2. **ManualRemittanceTabWrapper**
   - **Purpose**: Wrapper component that manages payment state and integrates with BulkOnlinePaymentWizard
   - **Location**: `components/missionary-dashboard/ManualRemittanceTab.tsx`
   - **Usage Example**:
   ```tsx
   import { ManualRemittanceTabWrapper } from "@/components/missionary-dashboard/ManualRemittanceTab";
   
   // Inside your component
   <ManualRemittanceTabWrapper missionaryId={userId} />
   ```
   - **Props**:
     - `missionaryId` (string): ID of the missionary

#### Payment Flow Hooks and Utilities

1. **Payment State Management**
   
   The BulkOnlinePaymentWizard component handles payment state internally, but you can also implement your own state management using localStorage:

   ```tsx
   // Store payment state
   const paymentState = {
     missionaryId: missionaryId,
     step: currentStep,
     totalAmount: amount,
     timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
     invoiceId: invoiceId
   };
   localStorage.setItem(`payment_state_${missionaryId}`, JSON.stringify(paymentState));
   
   // Retrieve payment state
   const paymentStateStr = localStorage.getItem(`payment_state_${missionaryId}`);
   if (paymentStateStr) {
     const paymentState = JSON.parse(paymentStateStr);
     // Use payment state...
   }
   ```

2. **Payment Status Polling**

   To implement payment status polling in your own components:

   ```tsx
   // Start polling for payment status
   const startPaymentStatusPolling = (invoiceId, missionaryId) => {
     // Clear any existing interval first
     const existingPollingId = localStorage.getItem(`payment_polling_${missionaryId}`);
     if (existingPollingId) {
       clearInterval(parseInt(existingPollingId));
     }
     
     // Set up interval to check payment status
     const intervalId = window.setInterval(async () => {
       try {
         // Check payment status using API
         const response = await fetch(`/api/xendit/check-invoice?invoiceId=${invoiceId}`);
         if (!response.ok) return;
         
         const data = await response.json();
         
         if (data.status === "PAID") {
           // Handle successful payment
           localStorage.setItem(`payment_status_${missionaryId}`, JSON.stringify({
             status: "completed",
             timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
           }));
           
           // Clear the interval
           clearInterval(intervalId);
           localStorage.removeItem(`payment_polling_${missionaryId}`);
         } else if (data.status === "EXPIRED" || data.status === "FAILED") {
           // Handle failed payment
           localStorage.setItem(`payment_status_${missionaryId}`, JSON.stringify({
             status: "failed",
             timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
           }));
           
           // Clear the interval
           clearInterval(intervalId);
           localStorage.removeItem(`payment_polling_${missionaryId}`);
         }
       } catch (error) {
         console.error("Error checking payment status:", error);
       }
     }, 5000); // Check every 5 seconds
     
     // Store interval ID for cleanup
     localStorage.setItem(`payment_polling_${missionaryId}`, intervalId.toString());
     
     // Auto-cleanup after 10 minutes
     setTimeout(() => {
       clearInterval(intervalId);
       localStorage.removeItem(`payment_polling_${missionaryId}`);
     }, 600000);
   };
   ```

3. **Payment Reset Utility**

   To reset payment state in your components:

   ```tsx
   const resetPaymentState = (missionaryId) => {
     // Clear localStorage items
     localStorage.removeItem(`payment_status_${missionaryId}`);
     localStorage.removeItem(`payment_state_${missionaryId}`);
     localStorage.removeItem(`payment_${missionaryId}`);
     
     // Clear any polling intervals
     const pollingId = localStorage.getItem(`payment_polling_${missionaryId}`);
     if (pollingId) {
       clearInterval(parseInt(pollingId));
       localStorage.removeItem(`payment_polling_${missionaryId}`);
     }
   };
   ```

#### Implementation Examples

1. **Basic Payment Flow**

   ```tsx
   import { useState } from "react";
   import { toast } from "@/hooks/use-toast";
   
   export function SimplePaymentForm({ missionaryId, missionaryName }) {
     const [amount, setAmount] = useState("");
     const [donorName, setDonorName] = useState("");
     const [donorEmail, setDonorEmail] = useState("");
     const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
     
     const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
       e.preventDefault();
       setLoading(true);
       
       try {
         const response = await fetch("/api/xendit/create-invoice", {
           method: "POST",
           headers: {
             "Content-Type": "application/json",
           },
           body: JSON.stringify({
             donationType: "missionary",
             recipientId: missionaryId,
             amount: parseFloat(amount),
             donor: {
               name: donorName,
               email: donorEmail,
             },
             notes: `Donation for ${missionaryName}`,
           }),
         });
         
         if (!response.ok) {
           const errorData = await response.json();
           throw new Error(errorData.error || "Failed to create payment");
         }
         
         const data = await response.json();
         
         // Store payment info for status checking
         localStorage.setItem(`payment_${missionaryId}`, JSON.stringify({
           invoiceId: data.invoiceId,
           amount: amount,
           timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
         }));
         
         // Open payment page in new tab
         window.open(data.invoiceUrl, '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer');
         
         toast({
           title: "Success",
           description: "Payment link generated successfully",
         });
       } catch (error) {
         toast({
           title: "Error",
           description: error.message || "Failed to create payment",
           variant: "destructive",
         });
       } finally {
         setLoading(false);
       }
     };
     
     return (
       <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
         {/* Form fields */}
       </form>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Payment Status Monitoring**

   ```tsx
   import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
   
   export function PaymentStatusMonitor({ invoiceId, missionaryId }) {
     const [status, setStatus] = useState("pending");
     
     useEffect(() => {
       // Check status immediately
       checkPaymentStatus();
       
       // Set up polling
       const intervalId = setInterval(checkPaymentStatus, 5000);
       
       // Cleanup
       return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
       
       async function checkPaymentStatus() {
         try {
           const response = await fetch(`/api/xendit/check-invoice?invoiceId=${invoiceId}`);
           if (!response.ok) return;
           
           const data = await response.json();
           
           if (data.status === "PAID") {
             setStatus("completed");
             clearInterval(intervalId);
           } else if (data.status === "EXPIRED" || data.status === "FAILED") {
             setStatus("failed");
             clearInterval(intervalId);
           }
         } catch (error) {
           console.error("Error checking payment status:", error);
         }
       }
     }, [invoiceId, missionaryId]);
     
     return (
       <div>
         {status === "pending" && <p>Payment in progress...</p>}
         {status === "completed" && <p>Payment completed successfully!</p>}
         {status === "failed" && <p>Payment failed or expired.</p>}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

#### Best Practices for Frontend Developers

1. **Security**
   - Never log sensitive payment information (API keys, card details)
   - Don't store sensitive payment details in localStorage or sessionStorage
   - Use environment variables for API endpoints in production
   - Implement proper validation for all user inputs
   - Handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information

2. **User Experience**
   - Provide clear loading states during API calls
   - Display meaningful error messages when payments fail
   - Implement proper validation with helpful error messages
   - Offer a way to retry failed payments
   - Provide clear instructions for completing payments

3. **Performance**
   - Implement debouncing for user inputs
   - Use optimistic UI updates where appropriate
   - Clean up intervals and event listeners to prevent memory leaks
   - Implement proper error boundaries to prevent UI crashes

4. **Testing**
   - Use Xendit test cards for development:
     - Success: 4000000000000002
     - Failure: 4000000000000036
     - Authentication Required: 4000000000000028
   - Test the complete payment flow, including success and failure scenarios
   - Test with different payment methods (credit card, e-wallet, etc.)
   - Verify that webhooks are properly processed

5. **Debugging**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify network requests in the browser's developer tools
   - Check localStorage for payment state
   - Verify that webhook endpoints are properly configured
   - Use the Xendit dashboard to check payment status

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues
